# CSE370-Project
Here are the files of Gym Management System project. HTML, CSS, JS (frontend) and PHP (backend) are used in this project.

The project can be divided into three major parts - Admin, Trainer/Staff, Customer.

TEAM MEMBERS:
1. ADMIN - Mihir Das
2. STAFF - Apurbo Sarkar
3. CUSTOMER - Abdullah Al Bari

SHORT BRIEF:
-> Customers cannot see anything backend related. They will have to sign up and sign in to the website open their own accounts and later on purchase what type of package they want for their exercise program. They can also give feedback in the website. Customers can see their own progress and also use todo to act accordingly.

-> Trainers/Staffs can handle the customers by accessing their routines. They can only see a few backend details like all the customer's details and their progress history also the company stocks (Graphs) [only the part they have been given access to].

-> Admin can handle all of the staffs/trainers and customers. Admin has all the details about everyone's background and access both staff's routine and customer's routine. He also has the full view over company analytics (Graph) and feedbacks of the customers. Admin has CRUD Operations implemented in all of his tabs meaning that he has ability to create/read/update/delete in terms of customers, trainers/staffs, equipments and so on. 

WHAT MORE COULD BE DONE:
The entire project was built keeping CRUD Operations on mind. The UI is also done well so that the customers have a user-friendly experience. Having said that, there is always some room to improve. So, I will look into it. Future improvements could be something in the line of implementing real-time transactions and introducing AI in both the frontend side and the backend side. AI can recommend exercise programs based on the information the user has provided and also it can help build a more efficient financial state for the admin such as predicting the market values of the equipment price. Currently, these are the spots where the project is lacking.

Anyways, here's to trying! ðŸ¤ž
